## **Overview**

**Amazon-Clone-with-Sentiment-Analysis** is a modern, data-driven e-commerce platform that mimics Amazon’s core features while integrating advanced sentiment analysis. Built using **React**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **MongoDB**, this project aims to provide a seamless shopping experience while leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze customer sentiments. The platform helps businesses gain valuable insights into customer feedback and sentiments, improving their product recommendations and customer service.

## **Key Features**

- **User Authentication & Profile Management**: Secure login and registration with Firebase Authentication.
- **Product Catalog**: A dynamic, responsive product listing with filters, sorting, and detailed product pages.
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Seamless cart functionality with real-time updates and a secure checkout process.
- **Sentiment Analysis Integration**: Customer reviews are analyzed using ML and NLP to detect sentiment, providing businesses with actionable insights.
- **Feedback Dashboard**: A real-time sentiment analysis dashboard for business owners to monitor customer sentiments.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores user data, product details, and sentiment analysis results in a robust database.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Fully responsive and mobile-optimized user interface.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (for API creation)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user data, products, and reviews storage)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python and ML libraries like Scikit-learn
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication

## **How It Works**

1. **E-Commerce Functionality**: Users can browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The platform mirrors core features of Amazon, including product categories, search, and filtering.
   
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Each product review submitted by customers is passed through an NLP model that detects the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative). This analysis helps businesses understand customer feedback and tailor their offerings accordingly.

3. **Real-Time Feedback**: Business owners can access a real-time dashboard that visualizes customer sentiments, providing insights into how their products and services are being perceived.

## **Features of Sentiment Analysis**

- **NLP and ML Models**: Uses pre-trained sentiment analysis models to classify customer reviews.
- **Customer Insight Generation**: Transforms raw customer feedback into valuable insights that guide decision-making.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Displays sentiment trends and actionable feedback in an easy-to-understand format.
